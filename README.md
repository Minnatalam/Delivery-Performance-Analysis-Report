# Delivery-Performance-Analysis-Report
Objective: Analyze delivery delays, revenue efficiency, and customer satisfaction to
propose data-driven improvements.
Key Findings:
• All regions average 2-hour delays, but West/South and Heavy/Standard
fleets are worst performers.
• 0% major delays reported (likely a data threshold error – needs validation).
• Revenue is highest in the West, but fuel costs scale linearly with distance.
• No correlation found between transit time and ratings (requires deeper
investigation).
• KPIs
